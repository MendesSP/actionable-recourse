- return types for audit

## Alpha Release 

- minimal test for audit 
- minimal test for flipset 
- minimal test for CPLEX vs. Pyomo
- easy setup

- ability to run code without having CPLEX or Pyomo installed (no ImportError)
- add specs to functions
- action_set should take in linear classifier from scikit learn
- simplify iPython [ex_01_quickstart.ipynb]
- README setup instructions
- README example 'https://github.com/cvxgrp/dccp'

## Paper Reproducibility

- german processing
- givemecredit processing
 

## 
- add test script for cplex v pyomo
    - should be easy to run  
    - max cost is close
    - no recourse cplex = no recourse pyomo;
    - recourse cplex = recourse pyomo
    - track cases where actions are not close and issue warning
