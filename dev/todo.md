- README example 'https://github.com/cvxgrp/dccp'


## Paper Reproducibility

- german processing
- givemecredit processing
 

## 
- add test script for cplex v pyomo
    - should be easy to run  
    - max cost is close
    - no recourse cplex = no recourse pyomo;
    - recourse cplex = recourse pyomo
    - track cases where actions are not close and issue warning
