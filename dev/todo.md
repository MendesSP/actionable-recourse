- action_set should take in linear classifier from scikit learn

- add test script for cplex v pyomo
    - should be easy to run  
    - max cost is close
    - no recourse cplex = no recourse pyomo;
    - recourse cplex = recourse pyomo
    - track cases where actions are not close and issue warning

- adjusting the decision threshold 
- return types for audit
- recourse / cost
