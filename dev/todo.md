- adjusting decision threshold
- Auditor class
- action_set should take in linear classifier from scikit learn
- easy install
- add specs to functions
- simplify iPython notebook
- minimal test for CPLEX
- minimal test for Pyomo
- README example 'https://github.com/cvxgrp/dccp'
- README setup instructions
 



- add test script for cplex v pyomo
    - should be easy to run  
    - max cost is close
    - no recourse cplex = no recourse pyomo;
    - recourse cplex = recourse pyomo
    - track cases where actions are not close and issue warning

- adjusting the decision threshold 
- return types for audit
